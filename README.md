About the site: 

The site which I have created is about about song famous song lyrics. It helps navigate to the three song lyrics by various artists.


How to run the ReactJS application:

   Primarily React is used for building user interfaces.In this assignment, I have used to ReactJs to build a website.React is built off of nodejs. Node Package manager(npm) was used to install dependencies in the server. 
   Sass is a css preporcessor which was also used to help design the website.npm was used to install both sass and gulp. Most of the commands are run on git bash with the help of npm.


To get the application running:
 Once all the files are code into the root folder, the 'npm start' command helps kickstart the website. The app.js file consists of all the functions of the website, while the default.css file consists of the styling part of the website.
Once npm start is run, the website picks the given port, in this case 3000 and launches the website.
